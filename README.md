## About Project 

The model predicts the Hand written digits using TensorFlow. 

Taken MNIST DATASET - 
1. It is a dataset of hand-written digits, 0 through 9.
2. It is 28x28 images of these hand-written digits.

Trained the model, my model predicted the test set results and I visualize it and found that my model was working nicely.
